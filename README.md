# nordic-darkeeeeer
Nordic-Darker-Transparent is an edit to the original KDE port of the Nordic theme. 

Changes in Nordic-Darker-Transparent compared to the original Nordic KDE port:
- Changed panel colors to match the Nordic-Darker Kvantum theme
- Changed launcher icon
- Changed the Nordic windows decoration theme to be transparent and to match Nordic-Darker
- Fixed many compatability issues of the Zafiro Icon Theme with KDE

Additions by me:
- I have added the Awave Konsole Color scheme and I have eddited it's background colors to match the Nordic-Darker theme
- Added a cursor theme (Qogir-manjaro)
